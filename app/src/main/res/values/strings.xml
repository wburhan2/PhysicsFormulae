    <string name="about_info"> We are planning to release the formulae as students progress through their college physics series.
                               We are starting with first quarter physics and plan to release more as time goes on.\n\nA project by:\n- Wilson Burhan (App Developer)\n- Jermaine Wegner (Physicist)\n\n\nPlease select the Feedback menu item if you have any comments for us. We strive to provide quality educational supplements to students and professionals alike.</string>
